# cs310-tic-tac-toe

This project is a simple tic tac toe game. In the master branch is a text based version
of the tic tac toe game. In the branch titled "Part 2" there is a GUI implementation of
the same game. The conditions for the end of the game are either an X win, and O win, 
or a tie. In the GUI version there is a simple 9 tile window, and by clicking on a tile
it will become populated with either an X or an O in text form based on whose turn it is
starting with X first. The text based version of the game is played through the console 
of the IDE, preferable NetBeans 8.2 as this is the IDE I used to make the game. The text
output is is 3 lines containing 3 "-" marks with row and column headers displayed above 
the game "board". To play, the player must enter in the row and column number that they
with to populate with their mark. The player will enter this parameters in the console of
the IDE. When a valid entry is made the console will print out the same game boad, but 
with the "-" mark corresponding to the row and column header replaced with either and X 
or O depending on whose turn it is. This project was created using Java.

# Getting Started/Deployment

To get a copy of this game onto your machine for review or revision, you will need to 
fork and clone the repository to your machine is a designated location of your choice.
You will do this using Git. After this is completed open your installation of NetBeans 
and import the project folder that you cloned the repository to into NetBeans. After 
this is complete open the TicTacToe.java file in the NetBeans project to build and run 
the game. The master branch will be the default branch so this will start the text-based
version of the game. To change to the GUI implementation right-click on the project and 
select "Git", then select "Branch/Tag", then "switch to branch...". A new window should 
pop up where you will select "Part 2". This will change the project to the GUI 
implementation. After that you only need to build and run the project. The GUI window will
appear after a successful build and you can play TicTacToe.
